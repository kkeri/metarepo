# metahack

A simple but powerful metaprogramming language.

Metahack is a prototype language.
It doesn't enforce a specific paradigm or type system on its users.
Instead it defines generic building blocks, and lets users
build their own concepts and develop their own languages
for their specific needs.

Be informed that metahack is work in progress, and it is a research language
without the intent of being a production quality tool.

and [design goals](doc/design.md).
